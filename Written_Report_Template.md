### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Within the Outcomes Based on Goals table, it would have been easier to write the formulas if the minimum and maximum dollar amount ranges had been in separate columns to allow cell references. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?<br /> 
  The month of May saw the highest number of successful theater campaigns across all years, from 2009 to 2017.<br />
  Campaigns are almost as likely to fail as they are to succeed when launched in the month of December.<br />
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?<br />
Investments greater than $45,000 were unlikelty to see successful outcomes. <br />
- What are some limitations of this dataset?<br />
There is no information in the dataset that could be used to derive profitability, such as revenue from ticket sales.<br />
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br />
It may be useful to analyse the successfulness of musicals versus plays by time of year within the Theater category.
