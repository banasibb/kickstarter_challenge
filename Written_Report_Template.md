# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was completed in Excel using a dataset that included performance of fundraised campaigns across eight categories and many subcategories. The data spans nine years, from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2017. Relevant to this analysis is campaigns within the "Theater" parent category and "plays" subcategory. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Two charts were created to address the client's specific questions regarding the success or failure of campaigns relative to the time of year (by month) campaigns are launched, as well as the fundraising goal (measured in dollars). 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart below shows performance of campaigns that are "successful," "failed," or "canceled" within the Theater category and subcategory of "plays" over the course of nine years based on launch dates. A total of 1,369 plays were included in the analysis, and no plays that were considered "live" were included in the results. A play is considered "successful" if the pledged amount to be fundraised exceeded the goal amount. "Failed" plays are those that were unable to reach the goal amount.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The chart below shows the percentage of successful and failed plays based on twelve different ranges of goal dollar amounts. These ranges are campaigns with goals less than $1,000, greater than $50,000, or in $5,000 increments between $1,000 and $49,999. The chart shows that plays are more likely to succeed than they are to fail when goal amounts are less than $20,000, or between $35,000 and $44,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Within the Outcomes Based on Goals table, it would have been easier to write the formulas if the minimum and maximum dollar amount ranges had been in separate columns to allow cell references. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?<br /> 
  The month of May saw the highest number of successful theater campaigns across all years, from 2009 to 2017.<br />
  Campaigns are almost as likely to fail as they are to succeed when launched in the month of December.<br />
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?<br />
Investments greater than $45,000 were unlikelty to see successful outcomes. <br />
- What are some limitations of this dataset?<br />
There is no information in the dataset that could be used to derive profitability, such as revenue from ticket sales.<br />
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br />
An analysis of how long the fundraising campaigns ran maybe useful in determining any correlation between the amount raised and the duration that donations were accepted. It may also be useful to analyse the successfulness of musicals versus plays by time of year within the Theater category.
